1: talker.c: Reads from STDIN, creates AVB packet and sends it to a multicast mac address.
2: listener.c: Binds to a multicast address, reads the AVB packets depacketize it.

Daemons Required: MRPD (sudo mrpd -i eth0 -mvs)

Application Usage:
------------------

Note:- This application is tested on tizen OS with Realtime Video/Audio with gstreamer-1.0 and MRPD
	daemon running on both the sides.

Usage:
On Talker: ./talker <interface name> <payload_size>
On Listener: ./listener <interface name> <payload_size>

For Real-time Video:-
---------------------------------------------
Tested with USB Webcam for yuy2(yuyv) format:-
----------------------------------------------

@talker side do:
gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src do-timestamp=true ! queue !  avenc_mpeg4 bitrate=50000 me-method=5 gop-size=0 ! queue ! fdsink | ./talker eth0 1024

@listener side do:
./listener eth0 1024 | gst-launch-1.0 fdsrc fd=0 ! queue ! decodebin ! queue ! vaapisink sync=false


For Realtime Audio:-
---------------------
A> Example Usage
@talker side: gst-launch-1.0 -v -e alsasrc device=hw:1,0 do-timestamp=true ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! wavenc ! fdsink | ./talker eth0 256
@listener side: ./listener eth0 256 | gst-launch-1.0 fdsrc fd=0 ! audioparse rate=32000 channels=2 ! alsasink sync=false async=false

Note:- The rate and channels in audioparse should be set appropriately depending on your microphone, you can see it by giving -v -e
       option in the alsasrc.

B> Example Usage
@talker end: gst-launch audiotestsrc ! fdsink fd=1 | ./talker eth2 512
@listener end: ./listener eth2 512 | gst-launch fdsrc fd=0 ! audioparse ! alsasink
