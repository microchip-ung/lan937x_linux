net: dsa: microchip: add support for fdb and mdb management

Support for fdb_add, mdb_add, fdb_del, mdb_del and
fdb_dump operations. ALU1 and ALU2 are used for fdb operations.

fdb_add: find any existing entries and update the port map.
if ALU1 write is failed and attempt to write ALU2. 
If ALU2 is also failed then exit. Clear WRITE_FAIL for both ALU1
& ALU2.

fdb_del: find the matching entry and clear the respective port
in the port map by writing the ALU tables

fdb_dump: read and dump 2 ALUs upto last entry. ALU_START bit is
used to find the last entry. If the read is timed out, then pass
the error message.

mdb_add: Find the empty slot in ALU and update the port map &
mac address by writing the ALU

mdb_del: find the matching entry and delete the respective port
in port map by writing the ALU
