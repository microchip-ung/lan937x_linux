System Setup

The Micrel KSZ8463 1588 PTP evaluation system is consisted of a KSZ9692PB SoC
control board and a KSZ8463 MLI demo board.

A ribbon cable is connected to JP3 of the SoC board.  Connect the other end to
J5 of the KSZ8463 MLI demo board, near the red LED.  A cable is connected to
GPIO 2 of the SoC board.  Connect it to TP8 of the KSZ8463 MLI demo board.
This is used for interrupt.  Connect both boards together.  Each board needs to
have its own 5V power supply.

The reset of each board is independent.  Occasionally it requires resetting the
KSZ8463 MLI demo board using its reset button for the network to be
operational.

The Micrel KSZ8462 HLI system is a simpler setup.  Just connect the KSZ8462 HLI
demo board to the JP2 connector on the SoC board.  Only the SoC board requires
power.


Software Setup

The source code provided generates the kernel and root filesystem image,
mImage.  It is located at system/release/KS8692P.  It can be downloaded in
U-Boot for testing.  To burn this image to the flash memory use these commands:

	tftpboot 800000 mImage
	erase 1c040000 +400000
	cp.b 800000 1c040000 ${filesize}


The GPIO 6 is used for PPS.  On the KSZ8462 HLI board it is located at J15.

The SoC GPIO pins are located at JP44 and counted up from the bottom left.
