SAM-BA Release Notes 
---------------------
Release version: 2.16
Release date: 2016


1 Overview

The SAM Boot Assistant (SAM-BA) software provides a means of easily 
programming different Atmel AT91SAM devices. They are based on a common 
dynamic linked library (DLL), the sam-ba.dll. SAM-BA use the DLL to 
communicate with the target board.

You are strongly recommended to read through the following release notes 
before completing the installation of SAM-BA v2.16.

  - Note for "not factory programmed" devices:
    SAM-BA needs a monitor running if use USB or COM port. 
    "not factory programmed" means that parts are shipped without monitor code.
    To make Sam-BA works for such chips with USB or COM port, we need a proper monitor code running. 
    ASF will include such monitor code as bootloader, Exact feature, such as: USB and/or COM port support, 
    OS support like Windows/Linux, are the feature of the monitor, please check with the monitor code you are using.
    For more information please visit product page at ATMEL's website.

   - Note for EDGB users:
    Sam-BA need to work with EDBG firmware version >= 2.11 or later. 
    You can download, install, and perform a firmware upgrade via
    https://gallery.atmel.com/Products/Details/6b4ba34d-d257-4ebb-9936-43952e724047.
    You can also use Atmel Studio 7.0 or above. Please follow the associated document.
