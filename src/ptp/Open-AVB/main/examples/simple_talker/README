EXAMPLE APPLICATIONS

The 'simple_talker' application illustrates the various steps to publish a stream
and streaming 1722/61883 audio frames after a listener connects. The audio
itself is a simple sine wave. It has been tested with other vendors listeners
at AVNu plug-fests.

The simple talker application requires root permissions to execute and 
attach to the driver.
	sudo ./simple_talker

To exit the app, hit Ctrl-C. The application gracefully tears down
the connection to the driver. If the application unexpectedly aborts the
kernel-mode driver also reclaims the various buffers and attempts to clean up.
The application should be able to re-initialize and use the transmit queues
without restarting the driver.

Note this application requires using the provided gptp timesync daemon to
provide the 802.1AS presentation times included in the 1722 frames. This 
application also requires the mrpd daemon to be running to detect and 
establish various stream reservation parameters.

Lastly, to build the application, you need to have the pciutils library
installed. the latest version can be downloaded from:

	< ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/software/utils/pciutils/ >.

Download and extract the library, and run 'make;make install;make install-lib'.
