	help
	  Say Y here if you want to use the WWAN driver core. This driver
	  provides a common framework for WWAN drivers.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called wwan.

config WWAN_HWSIM
	tristate "Simulated WWAN device"
	help
	  This driver is a developer testing tool that can be used to test WWAN
	  framework.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called wwan_hwsim.  If unsure, say N.

config MHI_WWAN_CTRL

	help
	  MHI WWAN CTRL allows QCOM-based PCIe modems to expose different modem
	  control protocols/ports to userspace, including AT, MBIM, QMI, DIAG
	  and FIREHOSE. These protocols can be accessed directly from userspace
	  (e.g. AT commands) or via libraries/tools (e.g. libmbim, libqmi,
	  libqcdm...).

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called mhi_wwan_ctrl.

config IOSM
	tristate "IOSM Driver for Intel M.2 WWAN Device"
	depends on INTEL_IOMMU
	help
	  This driver enables Intel M.2 WWAN Device communication.

	  If you have one of those Intel M.2 WWAN Modules and wish to use it in
	  Linux say Y/M here.
