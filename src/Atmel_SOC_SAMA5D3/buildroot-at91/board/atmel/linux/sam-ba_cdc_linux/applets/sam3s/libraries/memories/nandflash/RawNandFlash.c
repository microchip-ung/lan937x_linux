 * The RawNandFlash layer drives hardware-specific Bus Read and Bus Write operations to
 * communicate with the NAND Flash device. It directly interacts with hardware's register to
 * operate NAND Flash interface.The RawNandFlash layer code implement procedures to program
 * basic NAND Flash operations. It takes care of issuing the correct sequences of write/read
 * operations for each command. All functions in the layer are blocked i.e. they wait for
 * the completion of an operation. RawNandFlash layer access NAND Flash device by SMC.
