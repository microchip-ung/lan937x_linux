/**
 * \page ecc_nand_page ECC Nand Flash
 * 
 * \section Purpose
 * 
 * EccNandFlash layer is called by SkipBlockNandFlash driver, it will call the bl driver (RawNandFlash) 
 * to do write/read operations, and do ECC check to the write/read result, it then will feedback the 
 * ecc check result to the upper SkipBlockNandFlash layer driver. 
 * 
 * \section Usage 
 * 
 * -# EccNandFlash_Initialize() is used to initializes an EccNandFlash instance. 
 * -# EccNandFlash_WritePage() is used to write a Nandflash page with ecc result, the function 
 *      will calculate ecc for the data that is going to be written, and write data and spare(with 
 *      calculated ecc) to Nandflash device. 
 * -# EccNandFlash_ReadPage() is uese to read a Nandflash page with ecc check, the function 
 *      will read out data and spare first, then it calculates ecc with data and then compare with 
 *      the readout ecc, and feedback the ecc check result to dl driver.
